# Plugin Repository

The goal of this repository is to host useful plugins developed in the frame of Sinequa projects, by Sinequa employees, partners or customers.

You are welcome to contribute to this repository via [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). You may submit your Pull Requests from your own Fork of the repository, or by pushing new branches to this repository, if you are a member.

Each plugin must fulfill the following requirements:

- It must be packaged in its own subdirectory, along with its dependencies (forms, resource files, etc.), following if possible the standard structure of the Sinequa configuration folder. 
- It should also include a detailed README file explaining how to use it.
- The code should be clean, readable and commented.
- The code should be parameterized rather than hard-coded. When possible, use a **form-override** to make it is easy to use the plugin from the administration.
- The code should be fully anonymized and free of project-specific or company data.

Please contact us if you have a doubt about how or what to contribute.

Unless otherwise mentioned in the directory of a specific plugin, all the plugins in this repository are released under the terms of the MIT License. The source code is provided as is, with no guarantee of correctness, performance, or future maintenance and compatibility.
